# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## The Task

As part of Challenge #3 of my Coding Bootcamp a starter code with missing functions was given. The final goal of the code is to generate random paswords by asking the user the following: 

1. Lenght - Between 8 an 128 characters
2. If the password should include: lowercases, uppercases, numbers, and symbols. 


## User Story Given

```
AS AN user with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```

## Mock-Up
